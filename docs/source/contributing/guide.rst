There are several ways to contribute to the RPA Framework.
The following sections describe various ways of improving the project.

Reporting bugs
==============

Bugs should be primarily reported through the GitHub `issue tracker`_.

When making a bug report, try to explain the bug clearly, what
the expected outcome was, and possibly the steps to reproduce it. Attaching a code
example is very helpful.

The report should contain at least the following information:

- `rpaframework` library version
- Python interpreter version
- Operating system
- Error message and traceback, if applicable

If possible, supply a minimal example that replicates the problem. This
will help in tracking down and fixing the issue.

Requesting enhancements
=======================

If you think there is something missing from the project, it's possible to
request enhancements through the `issue tracker`_ as well. This can be anything
from new libraries to improvements in documentation.

A good enhancement proposal should describe the problem it is trying to
solve and - in case of a library - an example demo of how it would be used.

If you're unsure if the request is worth implementing, you can first ask
on the **#rpaframework** channel in `Robot Framework Slack`_.

Submitting content
==================

Instead of creating a request for a new feature, it is also possible
to directly submit Pull Requests via GitHub. Direct contributions
from external developers are welcome to any part of the project,
be it a new library or a fix to a typo in this documentation.

However, before submitting a large Pull Request, it's advised to discuss it
beforehand on the Slack_ or in a corresponding GH Issue on the tracker_.

Before writing any code, please read and acknowledge our extensive `Dev Guide`_.
