New Playwright based browser automation library. Upstream examples,
docs and issue tracker available at `github.`_

Install instructions
====================

The Playwright based browser library uses bundled browser executables as part of its package to avoid
browser version conflicts and to enable browser patches to maximize automation possibilities. In practice
this means that some extra steps are required to install it for use in a project.
